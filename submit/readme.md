## Submission Structure
Your submission should maintain the following structure:
- `metadata`ï¼šjust copy this
- `model.pth`: Your trained model weights (Note: In this template, model.pth is empty due to file size limitations. Please replace it with your actual model weights when submitting)
- `model.py`: Your model implementation code

## Submission Requirements
1. Make sure all your code and model files are included according to the structure above
2. Ensure your model.py contains all necessary functions for model loading and inference
3. Replace the empty model.pth with your actual trained model weights
